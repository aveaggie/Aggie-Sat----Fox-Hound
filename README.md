// Game is based on checkers but with a twist, where the player tries to outwitt the computer and get to the other side, and the computer tries to corner or surround the player. 
Instructions :


Enter your name and select Play to begin the game.
 Select your game mode. Play with a friend or try your luck against the computer, either as 
Johnny or the SEC defense. 
 Next select the SEC Defense you will be running against.

When playing as the Defense, select one piece per turn and move it around by using the adjacent black squares. The 
defense may only move forward. Your goal is to try and trap Johnny or reach the bottom of the board before Johnny 
reaches the top

When playing as Johnny select the black square that you wish to start on, on the bottom of the board. Move by selecting 
the black squares adjacent to yours. You can move forward and backwards. Your goal is to make it to the top of the board 
without getting surrounded by the defense. 
 The bar on the side of the screen indicates whose turn it is. 
 After the game is completed a screen will pop up asking for your name so it can be recorded and if it is high enough it will 
be placed on the high scores list.
